*"Jack of all trades master of none, that's how I'd describe myself. <br> I'm humble in my knowledge, possibly too much so.
Started my proper programming journey in 2022, been interested in software since I was a kid. <br> The world of programming feels so vast it sometimes feels like the more I learn, the more I realize I know nothing.<br> But I'll keep trying in hopes that someday I can make clean and simple code that feels satisfying and rewarding to me."*
