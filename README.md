*"Jack of all trades master of none, that's how I'd describe myself. <br> I'm humble in my knowledge, possibly too much so.
Started my proper programming journey in 2022, been interested in software since I was a kid. <br> The world of programming feels so vast it sometimes feels like the more I learn, the more I realize I know nothing.<br> But I'll keep trying in hopes that someday I can make clean and simple code that feels satisfying and rewarding to me."*

## 🌸 Being a student at the blossoming age of AI
There's no sugar coating it, the age of AI has sullied the credibility of college students across the globe. And for good reason, I've seen AI being used to float through college on a magic carpet of lies. <br> Personally, obviously I use AI as a tool but I try to limit it to only doing menial tasks. It's been my goal for the last year or so to find a way to increase my personal credibility by making personal projects and contributing to projects I find interesting. My code won't be the fanciest in the world, but at least it'll be original. And you can bet your ass I'll be a good developer one day, probably by the time I hit 60 or so..
